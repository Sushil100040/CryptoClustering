# CryptoClustering

The project is about using unsupervised learning and Python to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn is used to normalize the data from the CSV file.
Clustering the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data.

Used the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k. Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data. The inertia for the clusters with the PCA features is lower than the original features. The values within each cluster are much closer and its easier to compared in the data.
